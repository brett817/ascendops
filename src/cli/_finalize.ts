// Drain-safe process exit for the one-shot CLI.
//
// Node 25 keeps an inherited socket/pipe stdin handle ref'd, so a bus command
// that finishes its work but does not call process.exit() itself will not exit
// naturally — it blocks until stdin reaches EOF. In the agent runtime stdin is
// a unix socket the parent PTY holds open for an unpredictable time, which was
// the intermittent "bus command hangs" bug. process.stdin.unref() is not
// reliable for an inherited socket stdin on Node 25, so we force the exit.
//
// A bare process.exit() would re-introduce the classic footgun of truncating
// un-flushed piped stdout, so we drain stdout/stderr first and only then exit,
// with a safety-net timeout so a pathologically slow consumer can never hang us
// indefinitely.
//
// Dependencies are injected so the drain-before-exit invariant is unit-testable
// without actually terminating the test process.
