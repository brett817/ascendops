# init-agent-worktree.sh
# Idempotent: create the per-agent git worktree if it doesn't exist yet.
# Part of worktree-isolation pattern
# (your org internal docs).
#
# Usage:
#   init-agent-worktree.sh [<agent>]
#
# Defaults agent to $CTX_AGENT_NAME. Resolves worktree path from
# $CTX_AGENT_WORKTREE or computes $CTX_ROOT/state/agents/$agent/worktree.
# Framework root is $CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT.
#
# Exits 0 if worktree exists or was created. Exits non-zero on failure.
