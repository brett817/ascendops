# Sync the per-agent worktree to origin/main at task-start time.
#
# DESTRUCTIVE-RESET REQUIRES OPT-IN (an agent Nit 1 on PR #53, 2026-05-23):
# The hard-reset path can discard uncommitted work in the worktree. To prevent
# accidental loss on a routine refresh, the destructive path is gated behind
# --force-discard. Default behavior is a non-destructive fetch + status check;
# the caller decides whether to discard.
#
# Usage:
#   refresh-agent-worktree.sh [--force-discard | --keep-branch <branch>] [<agent>]
#
#   No flag           — fetch + status check; refuses to reset if working tree
#                       is dirty. Exits 3 (dirty) when discard is needed.
#   --force-discard   — fetch + hard reset to origin/main (drops local work).
#   --keep-branch X   — fetch + checkout X (no reset; stays on feature branch).
